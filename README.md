Project Title:
Potato Disease Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks

Project Description :
This project aims to classify potato leaf diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model takes an image of a potato leaf as input and predicts the type of disease affecting the leaf. The project uses TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the model, and Streamlit for creating an interactive web application interface.

Features:
Image Classification: Uses a deep learning model to classify potato leaf diseases.
Interactive User Interface: Provides a user-friendly interface using Streamlit, where users can upload images and get predictions.
High Accuracy: The model is trained on a large dataset and fine-tuned for high accuracy.
Real-time Predictions: Gives disease predictions in real-time, making it useful for farmers and agricultural experts.

Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for model development and application.
TensorFlow & Keras: Libraries used for building and training the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
Streamlit: Framework used to create a web-based interface for the model.
Matplotlib & NumPy: Libraries used for data visualization and numerical operations.
OpenCV: Library used for image processing.
